                        I was in primary school in 2006 when I was 6 years old&#46; I still remember during the first day of primary school I was very afraid of what was coming ahead of me and I am not very used to the environment&#46; However&#44; thanks to the school&#39;s buddy system where a primary 4 student will pair up with a primary one student and help them to get used to primary school life&#44; I was gradually able to adapt to primary school and make a lot of friends&#46; In the end&#44; I graduated primary with a PSLE T&#45;score of 235 which I think is a decent score&#46;

                        Secondary School had been one of the most toughest education journey that I had experienced&#46; My secondary school life had been full of ups and downs&#46; Ups such as me able to have a lot of great friends have a long lasting friendship with them&#46; Downs such as the mountains of homework needed to do yet with short deadlines&#46; The most stressful part of secondary life is especially secondary 3 and 4 where we need to start preparing for O levels&#46; This is because the teachers want to cover all the O levels content as soon as possible&#46; Teaching had thus become fast paced and I found it very difficult to cope&#46; Thankfully&#44; I persevered on and mangaged to finish my secondary school life and graduated with a L1R5 of 11 points&#46;

                        So currently&#44; I am a student in Singapore Polytechnic&#46; I think this is the best part of my education journey&#46; Even though&#44; sometimes it can be quite stressful due lots of work to do&#44; polytechnic life is overall still an enjoyable and fun one&#46; Let&#39;s just say in poly&#44; you are able to work hard and play hard&#46;
